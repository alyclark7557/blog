        <p>The first major resouce for anything I've learned in CSS or HTML is the W3 schools resources. They have articles for every basic HTML component and CSS property, and anytime I've had a question about how to use a certain tag or style rule, it has had an answer and example for me. In specific, the article I come back to the most is the block and inline elements article because that confuses me the most. It includes examples as well as lists of what elements use block and which use inline.
