        <p>I decided to research different CSS properties, and I tried to find ones that I particularly have found confusing in the past. For this week, I focused mainly on display, border, width/height. In the past, I have found display tricky because using the different values can very greatly change the flow of  your web page. Width and height are tricky because there are so many different measurement units. This article discusses what the different units mean in terms of how much space they take up on the page. Lastly, I chose to cover border because if you don't put the right values then the border won't show up at all. Three of the biggest parts of borders are border-width, border-style, and border-color. By specifying these, you can make you web page look clean and concise with great sectioning. </p>
