        <h1>Animations</h1>
        <p>Because I wanted to add an animation to my static site without using javascript, I decided to research CSS animations! <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp">This article</a> that I have linked has taught me a lot about different animations I can do without the JS code. For example, it goes over how you can set a duration or how many times it should go, whether it should go into the reverse direction, and it can also specify the speed of animation.Below, I'm going to include a code snippet of one of the example animations given to show how it can be used using only CSS and HTML.</p>

        <h3>HTML CODE</h3>
        <pre>
            &lt;div&gt;
                Example Animation
            &lt;/div&gt;
        </pre>
        
        <h3>CSS CODE</h3>
        <pre>
            /* The animation code */
            @keyframes example {
              from {background-color: red;}
              to {background-color: yellow;}
            }
            
            /* The element to apply the animation to */
            div {
              width: 100px;
              height: 100px;
              background-color: red;
              animation-name: example;
              animation-duration: 4s;
            } 
        </pre>

        <div>
            <p>While this is a simple animation, it taught me the basics of how to use keyframes and animation names inside of the external stylesheet. This will be important when I want to change the color or the styling of objects on the page dynamically. Also in this article, it discusses delay, direction, fill-mode, and the iteration count. All of which can be used to customize your animation for your specific purpose.</p>

            <h3>Implementation</h3>
            <div id="animate">Example Animation</div>
        </div>
