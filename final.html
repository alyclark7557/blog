        <h3>How would I design my version of the course:</h3>
        <p>
            I think for me the biggest thing is that I struggled a lot with the transition between the HTML/CSS world to being thrown into web services and react apps. Here's how I would structure my class:
            <ul>
                <li>I'd make sure some of the parts of the textbook are a little more obvious when dealing with code snippets since it isn't always intuitive where to go or what it's replacing</li>
                <li>Instead of two or however many labs a week, I think it'd be nice if it was possible to make one lab a week that incorporates all of the week's material. Then you work on it throughout the whole week and have it due Sunday at midnight; this also gives people the opportunity to work ahead if they know that they have a busy week ahead of them</li>
                <li>I also really liked the blog posts because it allowed me to do research on topics that I really cared about</li>
                <li>It could be useful in the beginning of the class to highlight what exactly the key points of the section was as well as go over any of the muddiest points submitted by the students</li>
                <li>I would provide links to examples that could help the students in the lab for the week</li>
                <li>I like the peer reviews on projects, but I don't know how I feel about asking a student to determine whose code is more manageable</li>
                <li>I would continue to strongly encourage the readings as well as do muddy points because I think reading quizzes just promote skimming of the readings instead of actual understanding</li>
                <li>I liked the use of slack as a communication network so I think I'd like to keep that</li>
            </ul>
